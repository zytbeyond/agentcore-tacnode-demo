Design System Rules
	• Favor simple layouts first, do not overcomplicate it.
	• Do not rush design. Build the interface one solid piece at a time.
	• Keep components pure and predictable. No global side effects in UI logic.
	• Don't fix visual bugs with magic numbers. Investigate layout properly.
	• Use consistent spacing units (e.g., p-4, gap-6). Never mix systems.
	• Avoid premature animation or interactivity. Nail structure and layout first.
If the UI breaks, backtrack to last known good state before iterating again.
