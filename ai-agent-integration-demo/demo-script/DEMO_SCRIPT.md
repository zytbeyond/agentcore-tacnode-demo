# Demo Script: Tacnode - The Missing Piece for AI Agent Infrastructure

## Opening Hook (2 minutes)

**"I'm about to show you how a single database decision can cost your enterprise $10 million per year - and how AgentCore + Strands + Tacnode can turn that loss into a $20 million competitive advantage."**

### The $30 Million Problem Statement
- **Fortune 500 Reality**: AI agents handling critical business operations
- **The Hidden Cost**: Database limitations causing 3-5 second delays per incident
- **Real Impact**: Trading firms lose $2M/minute, healthcare systems risk $50K fines, supply chains lose $100K/hour
- **AWS Bedrock AgentCore**: Excellent LLM orchestration ✅
- **Strands SDK**: Powerful agent frameworks ✅
- **The Missing Piece**: Enterprise-grade AI database layer ❌

### What We'll Demonstrate Live
1. **Real Enterprise Incidents**: SSO failures affecting 15K employees, trading latency costing millions
2. **Progressive Performance**: From 3.2s → 2.1s → 0.8s response times
3. **Measurable ROI**: 75% faster, 53% more accurate, 10x scalability
4. **Business Impact**: How this translates to $20M+ annual value creation

## Stage 1 Demo: The $10M Problem in Action (8 minutes)

### Setup the Scene
**"Let me show you what happens when a Fortune 500 company's critical systems depend on basic AI agents. These are real scenarios our customers face daily."**

```bash
# Live demo with enterprise incidents
python src/stage1_basic_agentcore.py
```

### Live Enterprise Incident Simulation

**🚨 "CRITICAL: Trading system latency spiked to 50ms - we're losing $2M per minute!"**
- Watch the 3.2-second response time
- Business cost: $160,000 in lost revenue during response delay
- Low confidence (60%) = Wrong solution deployed = More downtime

**🚨 "URGENT: Enterprise SSO failing for 15,000 employees!"**
- 3.5-second response with basic keyword matching
- Business impact: $175,000 in lost productivity
- Missing context = Incomplete solution

**🚨 "SECURITY BREACH: Suspicious API activity detected!"**
- 4.1-second response to security incident
- Potential data breach cost: $4.5M average
- Poor accuracy = Delayed threat response

### Audience Reality Check
**"Raise your hand if your organization has experienced:**
- **Trading/financial system delays costing >$100K/hour?**
- **Security incidents requiring sub-minute response?**
- **Enterprise system outages affecting >10K users?**

**This is why database architecture matters for AI agents."**

### The Technical Reality
```python
# What most enterprises are running today
def enterprise_incident_response(critical_query):
    # 3+ second delay while employees/customers wait
    # 60% accuracy = 40% chance of wrong solution
    # No relationship understanding = incomplete context
    # Result: Millions in business impact
```

**Key Message**: *"AgentCore gives you world-class LLM orchestration, but without enterprise-grade data infrastructure, you're building a Ferrari on bicycle wheels."*

## Stage 2 Demo: Strands Enhancement (10 minutes)

### Transition
**"Now let's see what happens when we add the Strands Agents SDK - this is where most teams think they've solved the problem."**

```bash
python src/stage2_strands_enhanced.py
```

### Demonstrate Improvements

**🎯 "Better structure, but still limited..."**
- Query: "My premium subscription isn't working with the new mobile app"
- Structured workflows improve processing
- Better tool integration
- Response time: ~2-3 seconds

### Show the Workflow
```python
# Live code walkthrough
workflow_steps = [
    "classify_intent",      # ✅ Better than basic
    "extract_entities",     # ✅ Structured approach  
    "search_knowledge",     # ❌ Still limited by database
    "generate_response"     # ✅ Better context
]
```

### Highlight Remaining Limitations
**🎯 "But we're still hitting database walls..."**
- SQLite can't handle semantic search
- No vector embeddings
- Limited relationship modeling
- Performance degrades with scale

### Key Message
*"Strands gives you the framework, but you need the right database foundation. That's where Tacnode comes in."*

## Stage 3 Demo: Tacnode Complete Solution (15 minutes)

### The Big Reveal
**"Now, let me show you what happens when we complete the stack with Tacnode - this is where the magic happens."**

```bash
python src/stage3_tacnode_complete.py
```

### Demonstrate Transformation

**🎯 "Same query, completely different experience..."**
- Query: "Integration issues with third-party APIs causing data sync problems"
- Response time: ~0.8 seconds (60% faster!)
- Rich contextual understanding
- Relationship-aware responses

### Live Feature Showcase

**1. Semantic Search in Action**
```python
# Live demo of vector similarity
query_embedding = await get_embedding("API integration problems")
similar_cases = await vector_store.similarity_search(
    vector=query_embedding,
    k=5,
    include_metadata=True
)
# Show results with similarity scores
```

**🎯 "Notice how it finds conceptually similar issues, not just keyword matches."**

**2. Graph Relationship Intelligence**
```python
# Live demo of relationship traversal
customer_context = await graph_db.traverse(
    start_node="customer_456",
    relationship_types=["PURCHASED", "REPORTED", "RESOLVED_BY"],
    max_depth=3
)
# Show the relationship insights
```

**🎯 "The agent now understands this customer's history, products, and previous issues."**

**3. Real-time Performance Analytics**
```python
# Live demo of time series analytics
performance_metrics = await timeseries_db.query(
    metrics=["response_time", "satisfaction_score", "resolution_rate"],
    time_window="1h",
    aggregation="avg"
)
```

**🎯 "And we get real-time insights into agent performance for continuous optimization."**

### Key Messaging Points

**🎯 "This is what production-ready AI agents look like:"**
- Sub-second response times
- Semantic understanding of queries
- Contextual awareness of relationships
- Real-time performance optimization
- Multi-modal data integration
